# Bottom Navigation Migration

## Overview
Successfully migrated the bottom navigation from being a component within `MainHomePage` to being an app-wide tab layout managed by Expo Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Tab Screens

**Created: `app/(tabs)/stats.tsx`**
- New Stats screen for performance analytics
- Placeholder UI with coming soon message
- Replaces the old "explore" tab

**Created: `app/(tabs)/leaders.tsx`**
- New Leaders screen for leaderboards and rankings
- Placeholder UI with coming soon message
- New tab added per Figma design

### 2. Updated Tab Layout (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)

**Main Changes:**
- ✅ Added 5 tabs matching Figma design:
  1. **Home** - Main dashboard/feed
  2. **Stats** - Performance analytics
  3. **Post** - Create games and content
  4. **Leaders** - Leaderboards and rankings
  5. **Profile** - User profile and settings

- ✅ Custom tab bar styling to match Figma design:
  - White background
  - Gold accent color for active tabs
  - Gray (#827F7F) for inactive tabs
  - Shadow elevation for depth
  - Proper spacing and heights for iOS/Android

- ✅ Custom icons loaded from Figma assets:
  - All icons use the same URLs as the previous BottomNavigation widget
  - Icons change color based on active/inactive state

- ✅ Hidden old routes:
  - `explore`, `discover`, `messages` - marked with `href: null` to hide from tab bar

### 3. Updated MainHomePage (`src/components/screens/HomePage/MainHomePage.tsx`)

**Removed:**
- ❌ `BottomNavigation` component import
- ❌ `onTabChange` prop
- ❌ `activeTab` state management
- ❌ `handleTabChange` function
- ❌ Rendered `<BottomNavigation>` component
- ❌ `bottomNav` styles

**Result:**
- Component is now cleaner and focused only on home page content
- Navigation state is managed by Expo Router automatically
- Bottom tab bar shows app-wide, not just on home page

### 4. BottomNavigation Widget (`src/components/widgets/BottomNavigation.tsx`)

**Status:** ✅ Kept as-is
- Still available for potential reuse in other contexts
- Can be used for modal screens or special navigation cases
- Not imported/used in MainHomePage anymore

## Benefits

✨ **App-Wide Navigation:**
- Bottom tabs now appear consistently across all main screens
- Navigation state managed by Expo Router (more reliable)
- Proper back button handling and deep linking support

✨ **Cleaner Code:**
- MainHomePage reduced by ~30 lines
- No navigation logic mixed with page content
- Clear separation of concerns

✨ **Better UX:**
- Tabs persist across screens
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Platform-specific styling (iOS vs Android)

✨ **Easier Maintenance:**
- Tab configuration in one place (`_layout.tsx`)
- Easy to add/remove tabs in the future
- Icons and styling centralized

## Design Match

The new tab layout closely matches the Figma design:
- ✅ 5 tabs: Home, Stats, Post, Leaders, Profile
- ✅ Icons match Figma assets
- ✅ Active state: Black text/icon
- ✅ Inactive state: Gray (#827F7F) text/icon
- ✅ White background
- ✅ Proper spacing and sizing
- ✅ Shadow/elevation for depth

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Enhance Active State:**
   - Could add gold underline to active tab (like in original BottomNavigation widget)
   - Use `tabBarStyle` on individual tab screens for custom active indicators

2. **Add Haptic Feedback:**
   - Consider adding haptic feedback on tab press
   - Already set up in the codebase (`HapticTab` component exists)

3. **Test on Both Platforms:**
   - Verify tab bar height and spacing on iOS and Android
   - Adjust padding if needed for different device sizes

4. **Clean Up Old Files (Future):**
   - Can remove `discover.tsx` once `stats.tsx` is fully functional
   - Can archive `BottomNavigation.tsx` if not needed elsewhere

## Files Modified

- ✅ `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Complete rewrite with 5 tabs
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/stats.tsx` - New file created
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/leaders.tsx` - New file created
- ✅ `src/components/screens/HomePage/MainHomePage.tsx` - Removed BottomNavigation
- ℹ️ `src/components/widgets/BottomNavigation.tsx` - Kept for potential reuse
