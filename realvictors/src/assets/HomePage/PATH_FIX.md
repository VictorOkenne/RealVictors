# Path Fix Summary

## The Problem

After renaming files, the error persisted:
```
Unable to resolve "../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png" from "src/components/screens/HomePage/mockData.ts"
```

## Root Cause

**Incorrect relative path depth!**

The path `../../assets/` was only going up **2 levels**, but needed to go up **3 levels**.

### File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── screens/
│       └── HomePage/
│           └── mockData.ts     ← Starting point
└── assets/
    └── HomePage/
        └── Images/
            └── rectangle-16.png ← Target file
```

### Path Analysis
From `mockData.ts` to reach `assets/`:

1. `../` → `src/components/screens/`
2. `../../` → `src/components/`
3. `../../../` → `src/` ✅ **Correct!**

## The Fix

### Before (Wrong) ❌
```typescript
require('../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png')
```
This resolves to: `src/components/assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png` ← Doesn't exist!

### After (Correct) ✅
```typescript
require('../../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png')
```
This resolves to: `src/assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png` ← Exists!

## Changes Made

1. **Updated mockData.ts:**
   - Changed all image paths from `../../` to `../../../`
   - Updated comment to clarify the correct path

2. **Updated Documentation:**
   - ASSET_MIGRATION.md
   - QUICK_REFERENCE.md

3. **Cleared Metro Cache:**
   - Ran `npx expo start --clear` to ensure clean bundler cache

## Verification

```bash
# From mockData.ts location, verify path works:
cd src/components/screens/HomePage
ls -la ../../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png
# Output: File exists! ✅
```

## How to Remember

**Count the folder depth:**
- `mockData.ts` is at: `src/components/screens/HomePage/`
- That's **3 folders deep** from `src/`
- So you need **3 levels up**: `../../../`

## All Correct Paths

From `src/components/screens/HomePage/mockData.ts`:

```typescript
// Images
require('../../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16.png')
require('../../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16-1.png')
require('../../../assets/HomePage/Images/rectangle-16-2.png')

// Would work for icons too (if needed)
require('../../../assets/HomePage/Icons/icon-name.svg')
```

## Status

✅ **Fixed!** Metro bundler is restarting with cleared cache.

The error should now be resolved and images should load correctly in the app.
